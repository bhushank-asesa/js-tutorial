Condition: Only solve the problem with recursion.

You run a pizza shop and offer three types of pizzas:
small: $7
medium: $9
large: $10

Customers can add an unlimited number of extra options: either "ExtraSauce" for $1 or "ExtraToppings" for $2.

Task:
Write a function that calculates the cost of the pizza based on its name as the first argument and any number of added options.
For example:
pizzaPrice('small');
// => 7

pizzaPrice('medium', 'ExtraSauce', 'ExtraToppings');
// => 12

pizzaPrice('medium', 'ExtraToppings', 'ExtraToppings', 'ExtraToppings', 'ExtraToppings');
// => 17
